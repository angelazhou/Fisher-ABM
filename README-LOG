**New Dependencies: Devectorize.jl (optimize devectorized code with minimal modifications) https://github.com/lindahua/Devectorize.jl 
Devectorize operates on: +,-,.+,.-,.*,./,.^,max,min,clamp,blend,.==,.!=,.<,.>, .<=, .>=, sqrt, cbrt, sqr, .... etc... 

Distance.jl implements faster Euclidean distance metrics 

Unfortunately some of the expressions appear to be too complex to be automatically unlooped. Cut down runtime by 10-15% by automatic devectorization. 

Fixed cross-platform issues and have a clean running version for Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit in Virtualbox. 
- Profiled runtime for one repeat: 
  Out of 1868 samples of sim_simple, approximately 56% found in fnc_distance in sub_functions.jl; 38% found in fnc_information. 



  Implementing Distance.jl should increase efficiency of calculating Euclidean distances. 
The periodic boundaries (lines 37-39 in fnc_distance) were particularly expensive as well. 
KDTree implementation of nearest neighbors should help find the nearest fish significantly faster.
